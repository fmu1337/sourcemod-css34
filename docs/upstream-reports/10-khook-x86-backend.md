# Only linux x86_64 is supported

Status: **draft for owner submission; not filed upstream**.
Evidence is existing downstream code/notes, not a fresh reproduction in this
change. Re-check the upstream tip and attach the requested logs before filing.

Target: alliedmodders/sourcemod (k/sourcehook_alternative branch).

Environment: SourceMod KHook `0cd7f6fcb4e3f09e0adb136f42dfa12305682bcc`
merged with master `6eb5f8fa381100ed7cac1ab62a4ece11795a5d92`
(downstream result `25954d4aa4a55ab10c6e2c30699f52358f982fb9`);
Metamod `05c5c63a9d595cb84021c3a51fe38366ba4a12a5`;
KHook `2a89535` (abbreviated revision recorded in the source notes).

## Problem and downstream fix
`AMBuilder` builds DHooks for linux x86_64 only, and the rewrite deleted
`extensions/dhooks/version.rc`, which the Windows build needs. The patch adds
`src/abi/x86.cpp`, a 32-bit backend for i386 System V (Linux) and MSVC
(Windows), and restores `version.rc`.

## Minimal reproduction

Configure the pinned KHook DHooks extension for Linux x86 and then Windows x86. Inspect whether a DHooks target is generated, and attempt to build that target. Compare with the downstream x86 backend and resource-file restoration.

## Expected result and regression check

Either a working supported x86 target is built or the platform is explicitly unsupported. This is a portability proposal as well as a regression against the old extension.

## Evidence to attach

Record exact dependency revisions, architecture, compiler, minimal plugin/harness,
and before/after diagnostics. The reproduction above is a procedure, not a new
passing test result.
